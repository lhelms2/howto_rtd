How to Create a Document
=========================

If you have not yet used Read the Docs (RTD), it is highly recomended that you start with the `Read the Docs tutorial`_.

.. _Read the Docs tutorial: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/

NCSA Document Template
-----------------------

The `NCSA document template`_ is avaiable in the NCSA GitHub. This template will be updated, as needed, so please start here when generating a new document.

.. _NCSA document template: https://github.com/ncsa/user_documentation_template

Drafting a New Document
------------------------

To start a new document, you will need access to the NCSA Organization in GitHub. If you do not currenlty have access, request access `here`_.

.. _here: https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/NCSASoftware/GitHub

It is expected that new documentation will have at least one editorial review and one SME peer review prior to advertising the RTD link to users. This will help to minimize errors in the initial user-presented product.

1. Use the `NCSA document template`_ from the NCSA GitHub to create your new repository. Instructions on how to create a repository from a template are available on `GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template>`_.
2. Contact X to import your new repository into the NCSA Read the Docs account. This can completed right after you create your initial GitHub repository, or after you've built it out (or anywhere in between).
3. *Before* you start adding content into your new repository, it is highly recommended that you create an outline for your documentation. The outline doesn't have to be anything fancy (pen and paper works!) but it *will* save you time in the long run.
4. Add your content into the various files in your repository, following the :ref:`style`.
5. During initial documentation development (before users have access to the RTD link), it is acceptable to build the documentaiton by committing changes to the main branch. When committing, include a brief description of the change(s) you made to the file in the 'Commit message' line and a more detailed description in the 'Extended description'.
6. If your repository has been imported into RTD, after you make changes to the GitHub repository, wait for RTD to rebuild the page (can take 1-3 minutes) and refresh the RTD page to view your changes. 
7. If changes don't reflect after 4 minutes, check the build for error messages. If there are no build errors, check your RST in the GitHub repository for syntax errors, RST is particularly sensetive to indentation and line spacing.
8. If you're still having issues that you cannot resolve, contact X for assistance.
9. It is expected that new documentation will have at least one editorial review and one SME peer review prior to advertising the RTD link to users. This will help to minimize errors in the initial user-presented product.

It is recommended that any new document have a minimum of one peer review and one editorial review prior to getting approved to go live.

For the recommended review/approval process for document edits/revisions see **link**.
